				<h3>My journey as a student in APC</h3>

				<div class="left">
				<h2>Swimming</h2>
					<p>When I was little we had a kiddie pool in our backyard, it is where I started to love water and swimming. Every summer we inflate it and I always stay there for hours. As I went older, I had a chance to be part of a swimming clinic for a whole summer. I signed up and I had fun and learned a lot from them. I signed up there again for the next summer and I was choosen to be one of the representatives of our team. It was my first competition and luckily our team won.</p>
